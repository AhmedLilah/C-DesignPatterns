Dear CND Team, 

I'm Ahmed S. Lilah.
I'm reaching out to communicate my displeasure/disappointment with the program so far.

Brief about me:
        * Analog IC Design/Electronic Circuit Design TA at Zewail City Nanoelectronics Engineering Program.
        * Former Circuit Simulation Product Engineer at Siemens.
        * Former Analog IC Design TA at ITI.
        * Former Analog Mixed-Signal Modeling and Simulation at Siemens.
        * Former Analog Systems Design Intern At Siemens.
        * Former Analog Mixed-Signal Modeling and Simulation Intern At Siemens.
        * Former Analog IC Design Intern at ITI.
        * Bachelor in Electronics & Electrical Communication and Computer Engineering.

I'll try to lay out my case as best as I can, especially from the Analog IC Design Side.

Pros:
        * Great Instructors/Lecturers.
        * Good Access to EDA Tools.

Cons:
        * So far the content of the program was so elementary and may be considered an introduction at best.
                * It lacks depth and most of the topics were skimmed over.
        * Some of the TAs were not prepared well for the labs.
        * Some of the TAs seem to lack the technical Knowledge in the courses they teach.
                * Sometimes they didn't practice the lab or set unachievable specs.
        * poorly designed lab experiments to the point of time being impossible or poorly communicated.
                * It was a common occurrence to have conflicting data in the lab document or that students were given circuit topologies that would never meet the functionality
                  required from them.

Looking at the contents of the advanced modules: 
        * The advanced Analog IC Desing module is lacking i.e. no mention of common analog IC design topics such as:
                * MOSFET large signal model.
                * MOSFET small signal model.
                * Small Channel effects (CLM, DIBL).
                * Gm Rout Method.
                * Single-stage CMOS amplifiers
                * Cascode Amplifiers.
                * Frequency Response
                * Current Mirrors.
                * Differential Amplifiers. 
                * 5T-OTA.
                * Gm/ID Design Methodology.
                * FeedBack.
                * Stability and Compensation.
                * Common-Mode Feedback Amplifiers.
                * Noise.
                * OTA Topologies.
                * Slew Rate and PSRR.
                * Variability and Mismatch.
                * Biasing and References.
        * The advanced Analog Blocks module is terribly optimistic about covering all the topics in detail:
                * Data Converters:
                        * DACs.
                        * ADCs.
                * VCOs.
                * PLLs.
                * DC-DC Converters:
                        * Linear Regulators.
                        * Switched Regulators.
                        * Charge Pump Regulator.
                * Layout.
        * The advanced RF IC Design module is optimistic about the following topics:
                * Noise in RF Circuits.
                * Matching in RF Circuits.
                * LNAs.
                * CG LNAs.
                * Mixers.
                * RX Architectures.
                * TX Architectures.

Looking from the perspective of the organization:
        * How will students design a transistor-level RF or Advanced analog block if they don't know Analog IC Design in the first place?
        * the logical flow of the advanced courses doesn't make sense to be all in parallel as the Advanced Analog Blocks and the RF IC Design both depend on the prior
          knowledge in Analog IC Design.

Suggestions:
        * Current Iteration:
                * allow those who wouldn't benefit from the program to opt out without the need to pay the 30k and preferably give them a certificate of recognition.
                * focus on giving students real practical knowledge that at least will make them get closer to being started on track such as in the ITI and NTI.
                * Refer them to external YouTube courses:
                        * Analog IC Design (Dr.Hesham Omran).
                        * Digital IC Design (Dr.Hesham Omran).
                        * RF IC Design (Dr.Ahmed Nader).
                        * Analog Systems Design ADCs/DACs (Dr.Hesham Omran).
                * Labs should be intensive as it's supposed to be and intensive training. 
                        * Refer to the labs that come with the previously mentioned courses.
                        * There should be an extended at-home lab work spread throughout the week.
        * Future Iterations:
                * Avoid accepting non-ECE students (preferably even not earlier than 3rd and 4th year students).
                * The Analog and Digital courses should start from the beginning.
                * Ensure sufficiently knowledgeable TAs.
                * Ensure the course content will be good enough to graduate proficient IC Designers.
                * Refer students to external YouTube courses:
                        * Analog IC Design (Dr.Hesham Omran).
                        * Digital IC Design (Dr.Hesham Omran).
                        * RF IC Design (Dr.Ahmed Nader).
                        * Analog Systems Design ADCs/DACs (Dr.Hesham Omran).
                * Labs should be two days not one to cover the courses.
                * Labs should be intensive as it's supposed to be and intensive training. 
                        * Refer to the labs that come with the previously mentioned courses.
                        * There should be an extended at-home lab work spread throughout the week.

Please accept my feedback on the program with carfull consideration.
